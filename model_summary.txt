## ðŸ“¦ Deliverable 1: SVM & XGBoost

â€¢ Support Vector Machine (SVM):
  - Performed well in high-dimensional space
  - Robust against overfitting
  - Strong ROC-AUC and classification accuracy

â€¢ XGBoost Classifier:
  - Handled missing data well
  - High accuracy with good precision/recall
  - Slightly outperformed SVM in AUC but required more tuning

â€¢ Resampling: Stratified K-Fold CV (preserves class balance)
â€¢ Best Accuracy: SVM across folds

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverable 2: RNN & LightGBM

â€¢ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):
  - Captured nonlinear patterns
  - Higher overall accuracy
  - Computationally more intensive

â€¢ LightGBM:
  - Very efficient and scalable
  - Performed well on precision
  - Easier to interpret

â€¢ Resampling: Stratified K-Fold CV
â€¢ Best Generalization: RNN (balanced performance)
